# Habit Tracker Web App

## Description
The **Habit Tracker** app is a web application designed to help users track their habits, visualize their performance, and maintain consistency. Users can log in with their email or third-party authentication (Google, Facebook, GitHub), create and manage habits, and view their progress through a visualized bar chart.

This project was developed as part of my personal learning process and is aimed at improving habit-building by providing users with a simple, yet powerful tool for habit tracking and performance evaluation.
